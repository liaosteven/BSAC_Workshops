# BSAC_Workshops
# In this workshop, we go through a few basic HTML examples to understand how information is stored via tags in 
# HTML. We then use this knowledge of tags to go through a few basic scraping examples in Beautiful Soup.
# Finally, we complete a project scraping the scores of NFL games from the 2016 season from Pro Football Reference.
